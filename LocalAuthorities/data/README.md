We have extracted values for `All ages` in `2020` and included the following additions:

* Created an UTLA `E09000001-12` composed of City of London (`E09000001`) and `Hackney (`E09000012`);
* Created an UTLA `E06000052-3` composed of Cornwall (`E06000052`) and Isles of Scilly (`E06000053`);
* Converted Dorset from `E10000009` to `E06000059`;
* Combined the populations of Bournemouth (`E06000028`), Christchurch (`E07000048`) and Poole (`E06000029`) into `E06000058`.
